## Overview

This repository contains the data used to demonstrate the utility of
[`visiumStitched`](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/visiumStitched).
Three
[Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression)
capture areas were collected from the lateral septum of the postmortem
human brain from one donor. We use
[Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) and `visiumStitched` to stitch
the gene-expression and imaging data into one sample, containing the
entire lateral septum, for downstream analysis.

If you tweet about this website, the data or the R package please use
the <code>\#visiumStitched</code> hashtag. You can find previous tweets
that way as shown

Thank you for your interest in our work!
