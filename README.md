# visiumStitched_brain

## Overview

This repository contains the data used to demonstrate the utility of [`visiumStitched`](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/visiumStitched). Three [Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression)
capture areas were collected from the lateral septum of the postmortem human brain from one donor. We use
[Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) and `visiumStitched` to stitch the gene-expression and imaging
data into one sample, containing the entire lateral septum, for downstream analysis.

If you tweet about this website, the data or the R package please use
