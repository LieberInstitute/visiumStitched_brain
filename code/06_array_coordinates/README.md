This directory explores alternatives to the array-coordinate-calculation
algorithm implemented in `visiumStitched` via the internal function
`.fit_to_array()`. Initially, holes and duplicate mappings motivated the search
for a better algorithm, but reasonable alternatives were found to be inferior by
a couple error metrics.
